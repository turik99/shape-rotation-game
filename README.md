**The Shape Rotation Game**

This is a web project  made with ThreeJS, ThreeFiber and React/TypeScript.
The object of the Shape Rotation Game is to choose the correct shape from a given set of 4, and match its orienation with the object shape.

I wrote this game after seeing "shape rotation skill" become a viral trend on tech Twitter. It took 3 days of frantic, 12 hour a day coding to build, but the minimal Twitter clout I gained from posting made it all worth it :)

You can play it at [[https://rotate-game.herokuapp.com/](https://shape-rotation-game.vercel.app/)](https://shape-rotation-game.vercel.app/) - Or just clone this repo and run "npm install", then "npm run start" to run it locally.
