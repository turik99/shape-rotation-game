# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This Project contains an awesome game made with ThreeJS, ThreeFiber and React/TypeScript.
The object of the game is to choose the correct shape from a given set of 4, and match its orienation with the object shape.

You can view it at https://rotate-game.herokuapp.com/ - Or just clone this repo and execute "npm start" to run it locally.
